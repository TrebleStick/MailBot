We decided to go with the Mail robot/Robot Postbox project because it has a decent amount of human interaction, it’s relatively achievable to get a Minimum Viable Product quickly, and it has a lot of scope for improvement. It is also highly parallelisable.

We set up a GitHub repository and a Slack team.

Javi will send an email to the lecturer explaining our idea and getting it approved.

Next meeting will be on Friday 10-11 AM.

Everyone will think on the idea and come up with a prototype with 7 parallelisable streams of work for next meeting.
